# odin-recipes

This project is part of the Foundations Course from The Odin Project, where I'm going to build a recipe website. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate what I learned of HTML until now. Whith this website, I can mainly show my skills working with text, lists, links, images, elements and tags.
